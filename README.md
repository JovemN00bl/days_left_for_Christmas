✨ Features

Minimalist Design: No window borders, title bars, or background colors. The text appears to float directly on your wallpaper.

Draggable: Click and hold the text to move it anywhere on your screen.

Context Menu: Right-click to access options (Change Phrase or Exit).

Persistence: Remembers your custom phrase even after restarting the computer.

Auto-Logic: Automatically detects the current year and adjusts for the next Christmas if the date has passed.

⚙️ Usage

Move: Left-click and drag the text.

Settings: Right-click the text to open the menu.

Change Phrase: Customize the text that appears after the number of days (e.g., "days until Santa arrives").

Close: Exits the application.

🔮 Roadmap / Future Features

We are constantly working to improve this widget. The main priority for the next version is:

[ ] Customizable Target Date: We plan to remove the hardcoded Christmas date logic. Users will be able to select any date (birthdays, holidays, project deadlines) via the settings menu, making this a universal countdown tool.

[ ] Font and Color customization picker.

[ ] executable (.exe) release for non-Python users.
